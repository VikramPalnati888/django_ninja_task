This project is a Django-based cinema management system with RESTful APIs for adding movies, 
listing movies based on their rank, and updating movie rankings asynchronously.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Activate environment
3. install requirements: pip install requirements.txt
4.Create and apply database migrations: python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate.
4. Run the Django development server: python manage.py runserver.
5. Access the APIs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/.




**ANSWERS**

Design and Implementation of Recommendation Algorithms:
Content-Based Filtering: This approach recommends items similar to those the user has liked in the past based on item attributes. I would utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie metadata like plot summaries, genres, cast, and crew details. This data would be stored in a database like PostgreSQL for efficient querying.

Collaborative Filtering: This method recommends items based on user interactions and similarities among users. I'd store user preferences and interactions in a relational database like PostgreSQL, utilizing tables for users, items, and user-item interactions.

Optimizing Database Performance for a Social Networking Platform:
PostgreSQL: Optimize performance by proper indexing, query optimization, and utilizing features like connection pooling. Use tools like pg_stat_statements for monitoring and analyzing query performance.

Neo4j: Ensure efficient graph traversals by modeling the graph schema appropriately and leveraging Neo4j's indexing capabilities. Utilize query tuning techniques for Cypher queries.

Qdrant: Implement efficient indexing strategies like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) for similarity search. Regularly monitor and optimize the index structure for improved search performance.

Using Celery for Asynchronous Task Processing in a Django Application:
Reliability and Fault Tolerance: Configure Celery to retry tasks on failure with exponential backoff to handle transient errors. Utilize Celery's built-in mechanisms for task acknowledgment and idempotency to ensure reliable task processing.
Monitoring and Logging: Integrate Celery with logging frameworks like Django's built-in logging or external services like ELK stack for monitoring task execution and errors.
Dead Letter Queues: Implement dead letter queues to capture failed tasks for later analysis and debugging. Configure appropriate alerts for monitoring DLQs to ensure timely intervention in case of task failure
